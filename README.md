## 🃏 Game Overview

Project Entity is a tactical card game where you summon **Entities** with unique effects while commanding the field through **Actions** and **Condition** cards. Your ultimate objective is to reduce your opponent's Life Points to 0.

Inspired by classic "no-mana" systems, the game focuses on hand management and tempo rather than a slow-building resource pool. Players must balance the raw power of **High-Level Entities**—which require **Tributes** to summon—with the reactive utility of fast-paced Actions and hidden Condition cards.

## ⚔️ Key Mechanics

- **No-Mana System**: The game eschews traditional mana curves for a system based on card advantage and strategic timing.
- **Draw to 5**: A core mechanic that allows players to replenish their hand up to 5 cards, ensuring the action remains fast-paced.
- **Tribute Summoning**: Powerful Entities cannot be summoned for free; they require the sacrifice of lesser units.
- **The Void**: Distinct from the standard Discard Pile, the Void is a zone for permanent removal, adding another layer of strategy to resource management.
- **Granular Stats**: A stat system based on hundreds allows for nuanced combat interactions and balancing.
